## For my future self when I am gonna be using this on a fresh Mac

I managed to get the flake to state when in installs some basic stuff.

use the scripts in this directory to install homebrew and nix then run the command from nix-run script

after that download my ansible repo and use it to setup ssh keys.

Will need to install kanata. First just try `cargo install kanata --version 1.6.1` and see if it's gonna work.
if not then try installing karabiner driver. see the kmonad file my ansible repo. it has it there automated.
